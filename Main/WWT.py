Wastewater treatment module for returning the required electricity and heat
Assuming 100% GW treatment

## No timelag in treatment included yet, assumed the input hourly gw is treated within the hour

## Recovery ratios are not considered yet!

## Membrane areas are calculated in vain for now

## Capex and Opex are calculated for maximum daily inflow
