    Fitnesses may be compared using the ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``==``,
    ``!=``. The comparison of those operators is made lexicographically.
    Maximization and minimization are taken care off by a multiplication
    between the :attr:`weights` and the fitness :attr:`values`. The comparison
    can be made between fitnesses of different size, if the fitnesses are
    equal until the extra elements, the longer fitness will be superior to the
    shorter.

    Different types of fitnesses are created in the :ref:`creating-types`
    tutorial.
